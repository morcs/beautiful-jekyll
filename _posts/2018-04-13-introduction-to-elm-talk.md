I'll be giving a talk, ["Introduction to Elm" at Warwickshire.Net](https://www.meetup.com/Warwickshire-Net/events/248032707/) on the 24th of April.

I've set up a page where I'll include a link to the slides, exercises, and follow-on resources, available here: [Introduction to Elm](/introduction-to-elm/).
