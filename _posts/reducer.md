So can whole programs really be implemented as pure functions?

In some cases they obviously can. The `bash` command `wc` for example takes some text as input and returns the number of words in the text as output. You could represent `wc` as a table with a row for every possible sequence of characters. The table would map the text in the first column to a word count in the second column. Every piece of text contains a number of words, and that number never changes.

But what about something more interesting like a web application or a video game? On first thought you'd expect to start the program with no input (other than maybe some config parameters), and after a time you'd expect it to end with no output other than maybe an exit/error code. All of the interesting behaviour manifests itself as data appearing in a database, or images being rendered to the screen. These side-effects would differ as the result of external things including user inputs which, from the machine's point-of-view, sort of appear randomly over time.
