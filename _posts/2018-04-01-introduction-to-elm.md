## What is Elm?

### Elm is a programming language

Elm is a programming language designed specifically for creating browser-based applications. In that sense, it's a bit like JavaScript. In many other ways though - it's nothing like JavaScript. 

One way it's not like JavaScript is that it's not constantly trying to trick you into creating bugs.

### Elm is a front-end framework

Elm 

## Why should you use it?

I think the main argument for using Elm is that it's much easier to write bug-free web applications than it is with any other method I'm aware of.

### There is no `null` or `undefined` in Elm

Most bugs in JavaScript 

### There is no `this` keyword in Elm
* It's really fast

- why
- functions

```javascript
let add = (x, y) => x + y;
```

```elm
add : number -> number -> number
add x y = 
  x + y
```

- types

- more about union types
- nulls
- errors

- elm architecture?
- subscriptions?
