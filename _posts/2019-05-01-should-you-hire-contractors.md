If you're trying to hire, finding good people in such a high demand industry is incredibly difficult, and you have my sympathy!

I recently finished my first gig as a contractor. It was a great experience and, reflecting on it, there are a couple of interesting consequences of hiring contractors from the client's perspective that hadn't occurred to me before.

One thing that struck me was the positive effect of hiring one or two highly experienced contractors to begin with, particularly in the context of a longer-term need to hire more people, both temporary and permanent.

There is a chance that if it's a good fit from both sides, you may be able to convince the contractor to join as a permanent employee, but I think there's an even more valuable aspect in terms of future hiring, especially if the contractor is local.

As a side-effect of the temporary nature of contract work, the contractor is likely to have built relationships many others in the field as they've moved around. If you're hiring, that contractor can probably put you in touch with and be able to recommend other people (as well as warn you against potential bad hires that arrive through other channels!).

Without wanting to be too hard on recruiters (obviously there are good ones who do a valuable job!), it's very difficult for them to vet candidates based on how good they actually are. Plus unfortunately there isn't a great deal of incentive to do so.

Likewise, along with being painful and time-consuming, I think most will agree that interviewing alone is far from a perfect method of assessing candidates.

Conversely, the contractor will know they are likely to have to work with your future hires. That means there's a much stronger incentive for them to only recommend good people when compared to commissioned agents. Plus their assessment is likely to be based on their experience of actually having worked with them!

Obviously there's an additional benefit of hiring direct/via recommendation - you may be able to save on recruiting fees.

In summary, when hiring contractors, or deciding how to hire for your team in the long-term, consider the additional benefit of focussing your initial efforts on just one or two really good freelancers, it might turn out to be a more efficient way of finding that team!
