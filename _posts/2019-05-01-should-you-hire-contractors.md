I recently finished my first gig as a contractor. It was a great experience and, reflecting on it, there are a couple of interesting consequences of hiring contractors from the client's perspective that hadn't occurred to me before.

One thing that struck me was the possible positive effect of hiring one or two highly experienced contractors initially, in terms of a longer-term plan to hire more people, both temporary and permanent.

There a the chance that if it's a good fit from both sides, you may be able to convince the contractor to join as a permanent employee, but I think there's an even more valuable aspect in terms of hiring, especially if the contractor is local.

As a side-effect of the temporary nature of contract work, the contractor is likely to have built relationships many others in the field as they've moved around. If you're hiring, that contractor can probably put you in touch with and be able to recommend others (as well as warn you against potential bad hires that arrive through other channels!).
