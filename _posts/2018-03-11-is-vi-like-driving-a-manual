Post in progress!

Why do so many people, myself included, still choose manual gearboxes when buying a car? It used to be that they were cheaper and more fuel efficient, but I’m not sure that was ever the real reason. Advances in technology have basically eliminated any real difference there, so why do people still buy them? Do they just like making life a bit more difficult?

I think a common justification is “it makes me feel more connected to the car”. But what does that mean? Maybe it comes down to the tactile feedback that’s involved in operating a clutch pedal.

When learning to drive, the clutch pedal is one of the hardest things to master. At least it was for me. Yet once you’ve mastered it, the whole process of feeling for the bite point and feeding the power to the wheels happens almost subconsciously. You’re still in control, but it feels like you told your body what to do and watched it do it perfectly. It’s satisfying!

I remember experiencing a stronger, but similar effect when I had my turntables.
