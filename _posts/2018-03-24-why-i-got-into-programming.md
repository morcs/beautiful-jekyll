The photo above is of my actual first computer - the [Sinclair ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum). My Dad bought it for himself originally, in what must have been the early-mid 80s. I think he'd seen the huge potential of computers, and wanted to teach himself some programming.

I must've been about 6 or 7 years old when he first showed it to me it. My memory is pretty vague, but I know I was completely hooked. 

What made the Spectrum affordable was that (as standard) it had no disk drive or monitor screen. Instead it was designed to be plugged into a home tape recorder (for loading/saving data to cassette tapes) and a standard television. In those days that meant _the_ television - the one in the lounge, so it was never a permanent setup. I guess my Dad must've got fed up with me constantly pestering him to set it up for me, as I managed to end up with it being permanently set up in my bedroom, plugged into an old black & white television that must've been handed down by my grandparents.
