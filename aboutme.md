I'm a freelance software developer from Leamington Spa, a town in the middle of England where many video game companies have grown up as a result of the success of [Codemasters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codemasters), which was started just down the road in Southam. I've never worked in the games industry myself, but like many of my peers, in a roundabout way it was games that were [why I got into programming](/2018-03-24-why-i-got-into-programming/) in the first place.
 
As a web developer with 17 years of professional experience, I've delivered bespoke web and mobile applications for customers ranging from startups to blue chip companies (e.g. Volkswagen Group, Dyson, Porsche, Inmarsat), both as an individual and leading a team of developers.

I like to work closely with highly-engaged users and product owners. I strongly believe that successful software is built incrementally, by delivering changes and responding to feedback in frequent iterations. I've found that appropriate use of practices such as domain-driven design, test-driven development and continuous delivery can be very valuable in facilitating this. 

Over the years I've worked with many different technologies. I'm happy using all of the current popular front-end frameworks (React/Angular/Vue/Elm) and have plenty of experience on the .Net Framework, both C# and F#, using SQL and NoSQL databases and AWS and Azure cloud platforms.
