I've created this page to support my "Introduction to Elm" hands-on talk. The slides are available on [slides.com](http://slides.com/morcs/introduction-to-elm).

## Code samples

The samples go along with the talk in order to provide the "hands-on" bits. In most cases the exercise will have at least one compiler error present, which should help to guide the solution.

## Elm resources

Some useful links for those wanting to learn more about Elm:

* [elm-lang.org](http://elm-lang.org/) - The official Elm website.
* [Ellie App](https://ellie-app.com/) - A brilliant tool that lets you write, compile and run Elm apps in your browser, as used for all the code samples in this talk.
* ["Making Impossible States Impossible" (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8) - Richard Feldman's talk on how to use Elm's type system to design models that make illegal states unrepresentable.
