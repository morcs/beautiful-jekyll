## Elm resources

* [elm-lang.org](http://elm-lang.org/) - The official Elm website
* [Ellie App](https://ellie-app.com/) - A brilliant tool that lets you write, compile and run Elm apps in your browser, as used for all the code samples in this talk.
* ["Making Impossible States Impossible" (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcgmSRJHu_8) - Richard Feldman's talk on how to design models/types in order to make illegal states unrepresentable in Elm using union types.
